## SnippetManager

### Overview

- Cross IDE (System-Wide) Snippet Manager.
- Forked from [**@xQsme**](https://github.com/xQsme/)'s [**SnippetManager**](https://github.com/xQsme/SnippetManager "essentially just a mirror at this point")
- Inspired by [**@davatorium**](https://github.com/davatorium/)'s [**rofi**](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) 
- Currently Windows-only (`C#`), though [**@xQsme**](https://github.com/xQsme/) has expressed an intention to _potentially_ release cross-platform version.
